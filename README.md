### Laboratory Experiment No. 1 Part B

 **NOTE:** This experiment was to be conducted in the previous semester for the subject of DBMS. Due to the pandemic situation, it has been included in the subject of BDA. Going further, we will use HTML forms with MongoDB to give it a flavour of the big data atmosphere.

### Objective  
To create an HTML Web form using Bootstrap, link it to the MariaDB database using PHP server side scripting language & performing CRUD applications on the form. To create a virtual instance on AWS EC2, install LAMP stack and to host the site & database on it.

### Tools used  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap4
- Backend: PHP7, PHP-MySQLi extension
- Database: MariaDB 10.4.11
- Cloud: AWS

### Experiment Outcome
- CRUD operations -> Insert, Select, Update, Delete  
- Make different webpages for CRUD operations  
- Use PHP with MariaDB for database connections  
- Note: Not using any Javascript & jQuery explicitly, except when used by Bootstrap.
- To create an Virtual instance on AWS EC2
- To install LAMP stack on the VM and host the site along with the database on it
